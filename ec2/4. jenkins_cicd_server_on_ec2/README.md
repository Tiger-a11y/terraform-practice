# Jenkins CI/CD Server on EC2 with Backup and Monitoring

## Project Overview
This project deploys a **Jenkins CI/CD server** on an **EC2 instance** within AWS, aimed at automating continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) workflows. The solution incorporates automated backups and performance monitoring to ensure the server operates reliably and securely.

Key features of the project:
- **Jenkins CI/CD Setup**: Automatically deploys Jenkins on an EC2 instance with a pre-configured setup for easy integration with other tools.
- **Elastic IP**: Allocates a static IP for consistent access to the Jenkins server.
- **Automated Backups**: Daily snapshots of the Jenkins data stored on an EBS volume to ensure data is safely backed up.
- **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Monitors the performance of the EC2 instance with detailed metrics (CPU, memory, disk) and automatically triggers alerts if any resource utilization exceeds a defined threshold.
- **Security**: The EC2 instance and network are secured using IAM roles, security groups, and VPC configurations, ensuring that only authorized access is allowed.

## Project Objectives

### 1. EC2 Instance Configuration
The EC2 instance is the core of this setup, and it will be automatically configured during launch. The instance will use either **Amazon Linux** or **Ubuntu** as the operating system, depending on your preference, and **Jenkins** will be installed via a user data script at startup.

An **Elastic IP (EIP)** will be allocated and associated with the EC2 instance. This is critical because **Elastic IPs** provide a persistent, static IP address that can be associated with EC2 instances in your account, making it easier for users and systems to reliably access Jenkins without worrying about the instance's IP changing after a restart. This consistency is especially useful in production environments where availability and stability are key.

Additionally, **CloudWatch monitoring** will be enabled to track resource utilization metrics, including CPU, memory, and disk usage. Monitoring these resources is essential for understanding the health of the server, as these metrics can alert you to any issues such as under-provisioning of resources or unexpected performance spikes. The CloudWatch Agent will be installed on the EC2 instance to gather additional metrics (such as memory usage) that are not collected by default.

### 2. EBS Volume and Backup
To ensure that your Jenkins data is persistent, we will attach an **Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume** to the EC2 instance. **EBS volumes** are durable block-level storage devices that provide persistent data storage, making them ideal for applications like Jenkins where data needs to persist beyond EC2 instance restarts. Unlike instance store volumes, EBS volumes retain their data when the instance is stopped or terminated.

As part of the backup strategy, we will automate the creation of **EBS snapshots** daily using a **Lambda function** triggered by a **CloudWatch Event**. This setup allows for **incremental backups**, meaning only the data that has changed since the last snapshot will be stored, reducing storage costs and making the backup process more efficient. EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, which provides scalable and durable storage for backup purposes. These snapshots can be used for disaster recovery, ensuring that you can restore your Jenkins server to a previous state in case of failure or data corruption.

In addition to EBS snapshots, an **S3 backup** of Jenkins configurations, jobs, and logs can be implemented for redundancy. S3 is widely used for backup storage because of its durability and low cost. Storing backups in both EBS snapshots and S3 provides an extra layer of security, ensuring that you have multiple copies of your data in different locations.

### 3. IAM Roles and Policies
To enable the EC2 instance and Lambda function to interact securely with other AWS services (such as S3 and CloudWatch), we will assign **IAM roles** to both resources. These roles define which AWS services the EC2 instance and Lambda function can access and the specific actions they are allowed to perform.

For instance, the EC2 instance will need permissions to access CloudWatch for monitoring and possibly S3 for backup purposes. Similarly, the Lambda function needs permission to create EBS snapshots. By using **IAM roles**, we adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions required for each service to function correctly. This is a best practice in AWS security, as it minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or accidental resource modification.

IAM roles and policies help separate duties and responsibilities, ensuring that each component of the infrastructure has exactly the permissions it needs to operate without over-provisioning access.

### 4. CloudWatch Alarms and Logging
To proactively manage the health of the Jenkins server, we will set up **CloudWatch Alarms** to monitor key resource metrics such as CPU usage, disk space, and memory utilization. CloudWatch alarms allow us to define thresholds for these metrics and trigger notifications when they are breached. For example, if the CPU usage exceeds 80% for a sustained period, the alarm will be triggered, and you will receive an SNS notification.

The **CloudWatch Logs** feature will capture Jenkins logs, including system and job logs. These logs are critical for troubleshooting any issues with Jenkins jobs or the server itself. By forwarding these logs to CloudWatch, we centralize the log management process, making it easier to track and analyze logs over time. This also enables integration with other monitoring tools for more advanced log analysis and alerting.

**SNS (Simple Notification Service)** will be used to send notifications via email or SMS when CloudWatch alarms are triggered. This ensures that the relevant team members are immediately informed when an issue arises, allowing for quicker remediation and reducing downtime.

## Real-Time Project Scenario

### Scenario Overview
In a large enterprise, your development team is using **Jenkins** to automate CI/CD pipelines for various microservices deployed on AWS. Each service is built, tested, and deployed independently, which means your Jenkins server is highly active and needs to be reliable at all times. However, with Jenkins running in production, potential downtime or data loss could significantly disrupt workflows.

The team has been using Jenkins on an on-premise server, but due to scaling challenges, they decide to migrate to the cloud to ensure better performance, scalability, and availability. The goal is to leverage AWS to deploy Jenkins while ensuring that it has robust backup and monitoring strategies in place to support 24/7 operations.

### Project Workflow

1. **Setting Up Jenkins on EC2**: 
   - The Jenkins server is deployed on an **Amazon EC2 instance** (Amazon Linux or Ubuntu). Jenkins is installed using a **user-data script** that runs on the instance's first boot, automating the installation process.
   - An **Elastic IP (EIP)** is allocated and associated with the EC2 instance to ensure a persistent IP address for Jenkins. This makes it easier for the development team to access Jenkins, as the IP address will not change after a restart.

2. **Backup Strategy**: 
   - A secondary **EBS volume** is attached to the EC2 instance to store Jenkins data (jobs, configurations, etc.).
   - **EBS snapshots** are automatically created every day using a **Lambda function**, triggered by a **CloudWatch Event**. This ensures that even if the Jenkins server crashes or becomes unavailable, a recent backup is always available for restore.
   - The backups are stored in **Amazon S3**, ensuring long-term durability and easy access when needed.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: 
   - **CloudWatch monitoring** is enabled to track the performance of the EC2 instance, including CPU usage, memory, and disk usage. By setting thresholds for these metrics, CloudWatch alarms are triggered when resource utilization goes above predefined levels (e.g., 80% CPU usage).
   - The team is alerted through **SNS notifications** whenever an alarm is triggered, allowing them to quickly respond to potential issues, such as a Jenkins job overload or system resource exhaustion.
   - **CloudWatch Logs** capture Jenkins logs, enabling developers to troubleshoot problems directly from the AWS console. This centralized logging solution improves the efficiency of incident response.

4. **IAM Roles and Security**: 
   - The Jenkins EC2 instance and Lambda function are granted the necessary permissions through **IAM roles**. This ensures that each component has only the minimum required permissions to function, following the principle of least privilege.
   - **IAM policies** grant the EC2 instance access to **CloudWatch** for monitoring and **S3** for backups. The Lambda function is granted permissions to create **EBS snapshots** on the attached volume.

### Use Case Benefits:
- **Reliability**: By running Jenkins on EC2 with a persistent Elastic IP, the system becomes more reliable and available for your development and operations teams.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Daily EBS snapshots ensure that no critical Jenkins data is lost, even in the event of a failure. Additionally, these snapshots are stored in S3, making recovery processes fast and easy.
- **Proactive Monitoring**: CloudWatch and SNS alerts ensure that any issues with the Jenkins server's performance or resource utilization are identified early, allowing the team to take corrective action before problems escalate.
- **Security and Access Control**: With IAM roles and policies in place, the system is secure, and only authorized users and services can interact with Jenkins, ensuring that there is no unauthorized access or misuse.
